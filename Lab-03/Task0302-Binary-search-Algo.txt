Declare an array of size 20.

Input 20 integers in sorted order.

Input the target element to search.

Initialize low = 0, high = 19.

While low <= high:

Find mid = (low + high)/2.

If arr[mid] == target, print “Found at position” and stop.

If arr[mid] > target, set high = mid - 1.

Else set low = mid + 1.

If not found, print “Not found.”

End.
