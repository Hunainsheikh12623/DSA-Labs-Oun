Algorithm (Linear Search for 30 integers)

Start

Declare an array of size 30.

Input 30 integers into the array.

Input the target element to search.

Traverse the array from index 0 to 29:

If current element matches the target, print “Found at position” and stop.

If the loop finishes without finding, print “Not found.”

End.
